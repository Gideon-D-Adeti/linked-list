# Linked List Implementation

This project provides a simple implementation of a linked list data structure in JavaScript.

## Introduction

A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of a sequence of elements, where each element points to the next element in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not have a fixed size and allow for efficient insertion and deletion of elements anywhere in the list.

This project implements a singly linked list, where each element (node) contains a value and a reference to the next node in the sequence.

## Features

- **Append:** Add a new element to the end of the list.
- **Prepend:** Add a new element to the beginning of the list.
- **Size:** Get the total number of elements in the list.
- **Head:** Get the first element in the list.
- **Tail:** Get the last element in the list.
- **At:** Get the element at a specific index in the list.
- **Pop:** Remove the last element from the list.
- **Contains:** Check if a value exists in the list.
- **Find:** Find the index of a value in the list.
- **InsertAt:** Insert a new element at a specific index in the list.
- **RemoveAt:** Remove the element at a specific index from the list.
- **toString:** Convert the list to a string for display purposes.
